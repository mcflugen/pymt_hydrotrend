name: HydroTrend
summary: 
  Climate-driven hydrological water balance and transport model that simulates
  water discharge and sediment load at a river outlet. HydroTrend simulates
  water and sediment fluxes at a daily timescale based on drainage basin
  characteristics and climate. HydroTrend can provide this river flux
  information to other components like CEM and Sedflux2D or Sedflux3D
